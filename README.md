Ride Options for Gusties

**App Name:**

**Need:** This app allows Gustavus students to post on a wall where they can tell other
students that they are in need of a ride. The user then can find someone that can give them a ride
to their desired destination. The need of this app is to provide ride share access
to students who do not have a car on campus. Many students who do not have cars are constantly looking
for people to give them rides from campus to Mankato, the the Twin Cities, or other various locations.
This app will give them a one stop easy access to look for a ride. The current way that students ask for
rides are positing on a Facebook group that most of the student body is a part of. By using the app, students
who are willing to give a ride to other students can check the app while other students who would not
be willing to give a ride or do not have a car will not be bothered by notifications.

**External Service:** Another factor of the app will including information on Safe Rides, Gus Bus,

**Sensor:** We will implement a GPS sensor that will allow students to post their current location
as well as their desired location. This way drivers can calculate the distance and time of the trip
and decide if they are willing to give the ride to the student or not.
